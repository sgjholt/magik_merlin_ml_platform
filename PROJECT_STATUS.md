## 🚀 Ready for Phase 2

### Next Phase Preparation
The project is now in an optimal state to begin **Phase 2: Core ML Functionality**:

1. **Clean Foundation**: All Phase 1 components working correctly
2. **Test Coverage**: Comprehensive test suite ensures stability
3. **Documentation**: Clear guides for development and usage
4. **Dependencies**: Well-organized requirements for easy ML integration
5. **Architecture**: Modular design ready for PyCaret integration

### Immediate Next Steps (Phase 2)
1. Install and integrate PyCaret 3.0+
2. Implement real ML workflows in `src/core/ml_engine/`
3. Connect PyCaret with existing MLflow tracking
4. Build interactive visualization components
5. Create end-to-end ML experimentation workflows
