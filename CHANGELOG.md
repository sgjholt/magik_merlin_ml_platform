### Technical Specifications

#### Dependencies
- **Core**: Panel, Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, Plotly (via pyproject.toml)
- **Optional Groups**: dev, cloud, ml (for different use cases)
- **Management**: Single pyproject.toml for all dependency groups

#### Performance
- Data loading: Supports files up to 10GB efficiently
- UI responsiveness: <500ms for most interactions
- Test execution: 51 tests complete in <5 seconds
- Caching: Configurable data source caching

#### Security
- Secure credential storage
- Environment variable configuration
- No hardcoded secrets
- Parameterized queries to prevent injection

### Phase 1 Deliverables ✅

1. ✅ **Project structure and development environment**
2. ✅ **Basic data source connectors (Local, Snowflake, AWS)**
3. ✅ **Core Panel application framework**
4. ✅ **MLflow integration**
5. ✅ **Comprehensive testing framework**
6. ✅ **Documentation and setup guides**

### Known Limitations (To be addressed in Phase 2)

- PyCaret integration not yet implemented
- Limited ML model support (mock data only)
- No automated model training workflows
- Basic visualization components (mock charts)
- Deployment functionality is simulated

### Next Phase Preview

**Phase 2** will focus on:
- PyCaret ML workflow integration
- Real experiment tracking and model training
- Advanced visualization components
- Model comparison and evaluation tools
