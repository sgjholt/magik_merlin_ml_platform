## Technology Evolution

### Current Stack (Phase 1)
- **Frontend**: Panel + Bokeh + Plotly
- **Backend**: Python + Pandas + scikit-learn
- **Tracking**: MLflow
- **Testing**: pytest
- **Data**: Local files, optional cloud

### Planned Additions (Phase 2+)
- **ML**: PyCaret 3.0+ for automated workflows
- **Deployment**: Docker + Kubernetes
- **Storage**: Git LFS for large files
- **Monitoring**: Application performance monitoring
- **Security**: Authentication and authorization

---

## Risk Management

### Known Risks & Mitigations
1. **PyCaret Compatibility**: Test thoroughly in Phase 2
2. **Performance with Large Data**: Implement chunking and optimization
3. **UI Responsiveness**: Async processing and progress indicators
4. **Deployment Complexity**: Start with simple deployment, iterate

### Contingency Plans
- **Fallback ML Libraries**: If PyCaret issues, use scikit-learn directly
- **Alternative UI**: Panel alternatives include Streamlit or Dash
- **Simplified Features**: Focus on core functionality if timeline pressure
